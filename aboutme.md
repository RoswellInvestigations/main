## I'm on the case. Private Investigator & Detective
I‘m such a good detective, you don‘t have to find me – i find you! Only :star: *premium* :star: services for your needs!

### I can help you with [anything*](smallprint.md)
Lost your honor in the deepest dungeon? Got your local dwarf stuck in a tower while throwing him and need to blur the tracks? I can help you with that and so much more!
I will listen, review and discuss each of your issues, then make a proposal to do the investigation. I will keep close with you to ensure your issues are fully understood, and handled confidentially, effectively and "within legal parameters".
